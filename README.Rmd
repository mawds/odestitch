This is a small Shiny app, built using [Golem](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/), that plots interesting ODEs (at present only the [Lorentz System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) is supported).

A 2d projection of the solution can then be exported to SVG The resulting SVG file can be imported into [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) where the [Inkstitch plugin](https://inkstitch.org/) can be used to output a file suitable for machine embroidery, where each stitch represents a time-step from the ODE solver.


## Installation

You can install the package by cloning the repo and, from the project directory running:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install()
```

## Run

You can launch the application locally if you have installed it by running:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
odestitch::run_app()
```

Or by running `dev/run_dev.R`

Or (probably easiest) run it from [https://mawdsl.shinyapps.io/odestitch/](https://mawdsl.shinyapps.io/odestitch/)

## Deployment

To deploy to shinyapps.io

```{r, eval = FALSE}
options(rsconnect.packrat = TRUE)
rsconnect::deployApp()
```

(see https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem/issues/1070) for why we need to use
packrat


### Inkstitch

Having generated an svg file the following briefly explains how to convert this
to a suitable format for embroidery using Inkstitch:

* Load the exported SVG file into Inkscape (with the Inkstitch extension installed)
* Select the resulting curve
* Choose Extensions -> Ink/Stitch -> Params
* Set method to "Manual stitch" - each time-step will then be a single stitch
* (You may wish to set maximum stitch length if some time-steps result in large jumps)
* You can then save the file in the appropriate format for your machine.

#### Troubleshooting

If you're running Linux, and find Inkstitch's dialogue boxes don't appear, 
restart Inkscape with:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
export GDK_BACKEND=x11 && inkscape
```

[This is because Inkstitch doesn't work properly with Wayland](https://inkstitch.org/docs/install-linux/#some-inkstitch-dialogs-disappear-after-a-few-seconds-or-dont-show-up-at-all)
